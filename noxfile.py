"""E2E test matrix for jupyter_ai_persona_manager.

Runs the Playwright/galata ui-tests suite under three transports so the persona
event/state pipeline is exercised end-to-end in every supported mode:

    - default   -- RTC-free, WebSocket ``WsChatModel``
    - jcollab   -- RTC via ``jupyter_collaboration``
    - jsd       -- RTC via ``jupyter_server_documents``

Each session builds an isolated venv (uv) and installs the extension -- the
prebuilt wheel via ``E2E_WHEEL`` in CI, or from source locally -- plus the
transport's packages, then runs the suite. Playwright launches JupyterLab from
this venv, so the server under test runs the selected transport.

The JS deps and browser binaries are expected to be present in ``ui-tests``
already (installed once at the CI job level, where ``playwright install-deps``
can use sudo); the ``jlpm install`` / ``playwright install`` calls below are
idempotent no-ops on a hit and make local runs self-contained.

Usage::

    nox -l                          # list sessions
    nox -s e2e                      # all three transports
    nox -s "e2e(env='jcollab')"     # one transport
